## Digital Clock

The digital clock works in the time format 00:00:00. It allows you to set your time in hour, minute and seconds, the time starts afterwards. 

When the time starts, the time colour turns GREEN
When the wrong time is entered, it displays an error message with a RED text colour


# The project helped me to have a better understanding on C. I made findings online on how to add colour to a text in C.
