## Digital Clock

The digital clock works in the time format 00:00:00. It allows you to set your time in hour, minute and seconds, the time starts afterwards. 

When the time starts, the time colour turns GREEN <br>
When the wrong time is entered, it displays an error message with a RED text colour

The project helped me to have a better understanding on C. I made findings online on how to add colour to a text in C.
